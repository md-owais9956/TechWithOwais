## What This Repo Contains

This repository is built with a **content-first approach** and contains:

- **Learning Paths** – structured notes on topics I’m learning
- **Blog posts** – chronological thoughts, experiments, and insights
- **Astro components** – base layout, header, footer
- **Global styling** – calm, minimal, theme-aligned CSS
- **Markdown content** – human-friendly and easy to update

## Philosophy

I’m a computer science student who learns by:
- reading
- doing
- reflecting
- and then writing

Writing these notes publicly forces clarity.  
If I can’t explain something to myself in simple words, I don’t truly understand it.

This site captures that process — unpolished, honest, and evolving.

## Stack

This project is built with:

- **Astro** – for fast, minimal, content-focused rendering  
- **Markdown** – for easy writing and content organization  
- **Vercel** – for simple, fast deployment  
- **Git + GitHub** – for version control and public history
