        <p class="intro">
          This page tracks what I’m currently studying and experimenting with.
          It’s not a course or a tutorial — just my learning paths, documented
          openly to stay consistent and clear.

        <ul class="learning-list">

            <li>
                <h3>Web Systems</h3>
                <p>
                    How the web actually works — internet vs web, browsers, servers,
                    protocols, URLs, and client–server architecture.
                </p>

            <li>
            <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
            <p>
                My learning notes on how the web is structured and styled —
                semantics, layout systems, and responsive design.

          <li>
            <h3>JavaScript Fundamentals</h3>
            

            <p>
              Understanding core JavaScript concepts by writing small examples,
              breaking things, and fixing them.

          <li>
            <h3>Git & GitHub</h3>
            <p>
                Learning how version control actually works — tracking changes,
                collaborating, and not breaking things accidentally.

        <p>
          I update this page as my focus changes. Some things are incomplete,
          some messy — that’s intentional. This is learning in public.
