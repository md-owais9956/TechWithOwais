        <p class="note-disclaimer">
          These are my personal notes while understanding how the web works.
          They reflect my current mental model and may evolve over time.
        </p>

        <!-- WHY -->
        <section>
          <h2>Why I wanted to understand this</h2>
          <p>
            I didn’t want to treat the web as “magic”.
            Before writing frameworks or backend code, I wanted a clear picture
            of what actually happens when I type a URL and press Enter.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- INTERNET VS WEB -->
        <section>
          <h2>Internet vs World Wide Web (the distinction that mattered)</h2>
          <p>
            The biggest early confusion was thinking the Internet and the Web
            were the same thing. They’re not.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>The Internet</strong> is the physical and logical network —
              cables, routers, Wi-Fi, satellites, and IP addressing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The World Wide Web</strong> is an information system that
              runs on top of the Internet — websites, pages, images, and links.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A useful analogy for me was:
            roads = Internet, buildings = websites.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- TCP/IP -->
        <section>
          <h2>How data actually moves (TCP/IP)</h2>
          <p>
            At a lower level, the Internet’s only job is to move data reliably.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>IP</strong> handles addressing and routing packets
              to the correct destination.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>TCP</strong> ensures reliability — splitting data into packets,
              reordering them, and re-sending lost ones.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The network doesn’t care if the data is HTML, video, or JSON —
            it just moves bytes.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- CLIENT SERVER -->
        <section>
          <h2>Client–server model</h2>
          <p>
            The web works on a simple client–server conversation:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The <strong>browser (client)</strong> makes a request.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <strong>server</strong> receives it, processes it,
              and sends back a response.
            </li>
            <li>
              The browser renders the response into a page.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This request–response cycle is the heartbeat of the web.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- HTTP -->
        <section>
          <h2>HTTP and HTTPS (rules of communication)</h2>
          <p>
            Communication only works because both sides agree on rules.
            On the web, those rules are defined by HTTP.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              HTTP is stateless — each request is independent.
            </li>
            <li>
              HTTPS adds encryption and server authentication using TLS.
            </li>
            <li>
              Without HTTPS, sensitive data can be intercepted.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- BROWSER SERVER -->
        <section>
          <h2>What browsers and servers actually do</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Browsers send HTTP requests, receive responses,
              and render HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>
              Servers store files, run server-side code,
              and respond to incoming requests.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The browser is the interface.
            The server is the decision-maker.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- ARCHITECTURE -->
        <section>
          <h2>Web system architecture (three-tier model)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Presentation layer:</strong> the browser (UI/UX)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Application layer:</strong> server-side logic
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data layer:</strong> databases
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Separating these layers improves scalability, security,
            and maintainability.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- URL DNS -->
        <section>
          <h2>URLs, domains, and DNS</h2>
          <p>
            Humans use names. Computers use numbers.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A <strong>URL</strong> is a full address to a resource.
            </li>
            <li>
              A <strong>domain name</strong> is a human-friendly alias for an IP.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>DNS</strong> translates domain names into IP addresses.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- CLIENT VS SERVER SCRIPT -->
        <section>
          <h2>Client-side vs server-side scripting</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side scripting (JavaScript) runs in the browser
              and handles interactivity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side scripting runs on the server and handles
              authentication, data access, and personalization.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Static sites show the same content to everyone.
            Dynamic sites customize responses per request.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- WHAT CLICKED -->
        <section>
          <h2>What finally clicked for me</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The web is layered, not magical</li>
            <li>Everything is request–response</li>
            <li>Browsers and servers have very different roles</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- GAPS -->
        <section>
          <h2>What I still want to go deeper into</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Caching strategies</li>
            <li>CDNs and load balancing</li>
            <li>Security beyond HTTPS</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
