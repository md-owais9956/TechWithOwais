          <h1>A Little Bit About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Hello, I’m Owais — a computer science student based in India.
            I enjoy understanding how things work and building software
            one layer at a time.

          <h2>My Journey into Tech</h2>
          <p>
            Like most people, my journey started with a simple
            <em>"Hello, World"</em>.
            But what kept me going wasn’t just writing code —
            it was realizing that software is logic made visible.
          </p>
          <p>
            I currently balance university coursework with self-driven learning.
            Most of my progress happens through experimenting, breaking things,
            debugging late at night, and slowly refining how I think about systems.
          </p>

          <h2>Why This Site Exists</h2>
          <p>
            This website exists as a <strong>learn-in-public notebook</strong>.
            It’s not a polished tutorial platform.
            It’s a record of how my understanding evolves over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of waiting until I “master” something, I write while learning.
            That includes confusion, revisions, and course corrections.
          </p>

          <h2>How to Use This Site</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Learning Paths show the order I’m learning topics</li>
            <li>Notes reflect my current understanding, not perfection</li>
            <li>Some content is marked <em>in progress</em> and will change</li>
            <li>If something feels rough, it probably means I’m still learning it</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What I’m Focused On Right Now</h2>

          <h2>Let’s Connect</h2>
          <p>
            I’m always open to discussing ideas, learning approaches,
            or just connecting with other developers who enjoy building
            things thoughtfully.
