                <h1>A Little Bit About Me</h1>
                <p class="intro">
                Hello there! I'm Owais, a computer science student based in India, with a huge passion for building things with code.
                </p>

                <h2>My Journey into Tech</h2>
                <p>
                Like many others, my journey started with a simple "Hello, World!" program. But from that moment, I was hooked. The ability to create something functional and useful out of nothing but logic and keystrokes felt like a superpower. I spend my days juggling university lectures and assignments, but my nights are often spent exploring new technologies, debugging a stubborn piece of code, or sketching out my next project idea.
                </p>

                <h2>Why This Blog Exists</h2>
                <p>
                I created this blog as a way to "learn in public." It serves as my personal knowledge base, a portfolio of my work, and a platform to connect with like-minded people. My goal is to break down complex topics into simple terms and to document the real, unfiltered process of building softwareâ€”including all the mistakes and lessons along the way.
                </p>

                <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
                <p>
                I'm always open to discussing tech, new ideas, or just connecting with fellow developers. Feel free to reach out!
