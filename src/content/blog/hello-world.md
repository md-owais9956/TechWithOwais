“Hello, World!” is usually the first thing you write when learning a new language.  
This post is that equivalent for this blog.

Not a launch. Not a tutorial series.  
Just a starting point.

## Why this blog exists

I’m a computer science student, and most of my learning happens in fragments:
half-finished notes, experiments that live only on my laptop, and moments where something finally makes sense — and then disappears a week later.

This blog is an attempt to slow that down.

I’m writing to:
- make my understanding clearer to *myself*
- keep track of how my thinking changes over time
- document what I’m building while I’m still building it

These posts aren’t meant to be authoritative or complete.  
They’re snapshots of where I am *right now*.

## What this space is (and isn’t)

This is **not**:
- a polished tutorial site  
- a “follow these steps” blog  
- a place where everything is correct forever  

This **is**:
- a public learning journal  
- notes written after things click (or don’t)
- explanations I write to check whether I actually understand something
- mistakes, rewrites, and changing opinions

Older posts may be incomplete or even wrong.  
That’s part of the point.

## What I’ll be writing about

Most of what shows up here will revolve around:
- JavaScript and how it behaves in the browser
- Web development fundamentals
- Small projects and experiments
- Concepts that confused me longer than they should have

Sometimes a post will be short.  
Sometimes it’ll just be thoughts and observations.  
Sometimes it’ll exist only so future-me remembers *why* something worked.

## A note on the tech

I built this site myself because I wanted full control over it and to understand how it works.

The stack is simple:
- **Astro**, because it stays out of the way
- **Markdown**, because writing should feel lightweight
- **Vercel**, because deployment shouldn’t be a project by itself

The blog itself is also part of the learning process — I’ll probably change things as I go.

## That’s it for now

This post isn’t meant to say much more than:
> I’m starting, and I’m documenting it.

If you’re also learning, building, or figuring things out as you go, you’ll probably recognize some of the same patterns here.

This is just the first entry.
