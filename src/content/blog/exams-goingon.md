Exams – they’re here again. As a B.Tech student, this time always feels like a mix of stress, long nights, and endless cups of chai. Since my exams are going on right now, I thought I’d share how I’m managing them. Maybe it helps, maybe you’ll relate, or maybe you’ll just laugh at my struggle. Either way, here we go!  

### How I’m Studying Right Now  

Instead of trying to cover everything, I’m focusing on the important topics, formulas, and concepts. Revising a few things properly is way better than rushing through the entire syllabus.  

I’m also practicing previous year questions, because in the exam hall, writing speed and clarity matter just as much as knowledge.  

### Food and Sleep  

Earlier, I used to cut down on sleep thinking I’d “study more.” Big mistake. Now I make sure to get at least 6 hours of proper rest so my brain actually works during the exam.  

Snacks and water have become my best friends during study time—small things, but they keep me going.  

### Staying Positive  

Not gonna lie, exams do make me anxious. But I remind myself: exams are temporary, knowledge is permanent. I’ve put in the work, and the rest I leave to Allah. That thought keeps me calm and focused.  

### Wrapping It Up  

Exams are tough, but they’re also just another phase of student life. Once they’re done, I know I’ll feel proud that I gave my best.  

To all my fellow students out there—good luck! We’re in this together.

 My next blog will be out **after my exams end**. Till then, wish me luck—and all the best to everyone fighting the same exam battle right now!
