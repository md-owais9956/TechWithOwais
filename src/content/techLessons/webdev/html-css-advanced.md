##  Advanced HTML (Rich Data, Accessibility & APIs)

At this level, you move beyond static documents. You start working with browser APIs, providing rich data for machines, and building accessible, dynamic widgets that feel like native applications.

### 1\. Rich Structured Data (JSON-LD)

Your intermediate doc covered `meta` tags for basic SEO and social sharing (Open Graph). The advanced level is **Structured Data**, which tells search engines *exactly* what your content is about (a recipe, an event, a product, an article) so it can be shown in rich results.

**Code Snippet:** (This goes in your `<head>`)

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BlogPosting",
  "headline": "Mr. Whiskers' Deep Thoughts on Cat Philosophy",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Mohd. Owais"
  },
  "datePublished": "2025-10-27",
  "image": "https://techwithowais.co.in/images/mr-whiskers-og.jpg",
  "articleBody": "Today, Mr. Whiskers explored the existential void between his morning nap and his afternoon snack..."
}
</script>
```

**Conceptual Explanations:**

  * **`type="application/ld+json"`**: This tells the browser this `<script>` tag contains **JSON-LD** (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data), not executable JavaScript.
  * **`@context` & `@type`**: This is the "dictionary." You're telling Google, "I'm using the vocabulary from `schema.org`, and the specific 'thing' I'm describing is a `BlogPosting`."
  * **Why it's advanced:** This is how you power "Rich Snippets" in Googleâ€”think recipe cards, review stars, and event times right in the search results. You are no longer just *describing* your page; you are providing machine-readable **data**.

### 2\. The `<dialog>` Element

You used to need complex JavaScript and CSS to create a modal (a pop-up window). HTML now gives us a native, accessible, and powerful element for this.

**Code Snippet:**

```html
<button id="open-modal">Show Modal</button>

<dialog id="my-modal">
  <form method="dialog">
    <h3>This is a modal!</h3>
    <p>It's native HTML. It traps focus and is accessible by default.</p>
    <button type="submit">Close</button>
  </form>
</dialog>

<script>
  const modal = document.getElementById('my-modal');
  const openBtn = document.getElementById('open-modal');
  
  openBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    modal.showModal(); // This is the magic browser API
  });
</script>
```

**Conceptual Explanations:**

  * **`<dialog>`**: This element is hidden by default.
  * **`modal.showModal()`**: This JavaScript API call does three crucial things:
    1.  Displays the dialog.
    2.  Puts it in a "top layer," above all other content (even content with `z-index: 9999`).
    3.  **Traps focus**: Pressing "Tab" will only cycle between focusable elements *inside* the modal, which is a critical accessibility win.
  * **`method="dialog"`**: This form attribute makes any button inside it close the dialog, no extra JS needed.

### 3\. Advanced Accessibility (ARIA Widgets)

Intermediate HTML focused on *semantic* accessibility (like `label`). Advanced accessibility is about using **ARIA** (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles to build complex, *dynamic* widgets that don't have native HTML tags (like a custom tab group).

**Code Snippet:** (This requires JavaScript to function)

```html
<div class="tabs">
  <div role="tablist" aria-label="Example Tabs">
    <button role="tab" aria-selected="true" id="tab-1" aria-controls="panel-1">
      Tab 1
    </button>
    <button role="tab" aria-selected="false" id="tab-2" aria-controls="panel-2" tabindex="-1">
      Tab 2
    </button>
  </div>
  
  <div role="tabpanel" id="panel-1" aria-labelledby="tab-1">
    <p>Content for Tab 1...</p>
  </div>
  <div role="tabpanel" id="panel-2" aria-labelledby="tab-2" hidden>
    <p>Content for Tab 2...</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Conceptual Explanations:**

  * **`role="tablist"`**: Tells a screen reader, "This is a container for tab buttons."
  * **`role="tab"`**: Identifies a button as a tab control.
  * **`aria-selected="true/false"`**: The most important part. It tells the screen reader which tab is *currently active*. (You must toggle this with JavaScript).
  * **`aria-controls="panel-1"`**: Links the button to the panel it controls.
  * **`role="tabpanel"`**: Identifies a container as a content panel.
  * **`aria-labelledby="tab-1"`**: Links the panel back to its controlling button.
  * **`hidden`**: This HTML attribute hides the inactive panel visually *and* from screen readers.

### 4\. Advanced Media (`<video>` & Inline `<svg>`)

You've mastered `<img>`. Now, let's look at media you can control and style.

**Code Snippet:**

```html
<video controls preload="metadata" poster="mr-whiskers-poster.jpg">
  <source src="mr-whiskers.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="mr-whiskers.webm" type="video/webm">
  <track
    label="English"
    kind="subtitles"
    srclang="en"
    src="subtitles-en.vtt"
    default>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video tag.</p>
</video>

<svg 
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" 
  viewBox="0 0 100 100" 
  class="icon-heart"
  aria-label="Heart icon"
  role="img"
>
  <path d="M 50,90 C 10,60 40,30 50,50 C 60,30 90,60 50,90 Z" />
</svg>
```

```css
/* You can style inline SVG elements just like HTML! */
.icon-heart {
  width: 50px;
  fill: grey;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}
.icon-heart:hover {
  fill: red;
  transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

**Conceptual Explanations:**

  * **Multiple `<source>`s**: You provide both MP4 and WebM files. The browser will pick the *first one* it supports.
  * **`preload="metadata"`**: A performance trick. It tells the browser to *only* load the video's metadata (like duration, dimensions) on page load, not the whole video file.
  * **`<track>`**: This is for accessibility, providing captions, subtitles, or descriptions.
  * **Inline `<svg>`**: By pasting the SVG code directly into your HTML (instead of `<img>`), you get two superpowers:
    1.  It's part of the DOM, so CSS can style its individual `path`, `circle`, etc. (e.g., change the `fill` color on hover).
    2.  It saves an HTTP request, which is faster.

##  Advanced CSS (Dynamics, Selectors & Modern Layout)

This level is about writing CSS that is smarter, more dynamic, and less brittle. You'll stop thinking about "pages" and start thinking about "components."

### 1\. Advanced Selectors (`:has()`, `:is()`, Attribute)

For decades, CSS could only select "down" (parent \> child). The new `:has()` selector lets you select "up" or "sideways," changing the parent based on its children.

**Code Snippet:**

```html
<div class="card">
  <h4>A Card Title</h4>
  <p>Some text content...</p>
</div>

<div class="card card--has-image">
  <img src="img.jpg" alt="example">
  <h4>A Card with an Image</h4>
  <p>This one has a different layout.</p>
</div>

<div class="form-group">
  <label for="email">Email</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" required>
</div>
```

```css
/* 1. The :has() "Parent" Selector */
.card:has(img) {
  /* Selects any .card that has an <img> inside it */
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 1rem;
}

/* 2. The Attribute Selector */
.form-group:has(input:required) label::after {
  /* Selects the label IN a group that has a required input */
  content: " *";
  color: red;
}

/* 3. The :is() "Matcher" Selector */
/* OLD WAY */
.article header h1,
.article header h2,
.article header p {
  color: #333;
}

/* NEW WAY with :is() */
.article header :is(h1, h2, p) {
  /* Selects h1, h2, OR p that is a descendant of header */
  color: #333;
}
```

**Conceptual Explanations:**

  * **`:has(img)`**: This is revolutionary. You're styling the `.card` *based on its contents*. This replaces the need for modifier classes like `.card--has-image`.
  * **Attribute Selectors (`:required`)**: You can select elements based on their HTML attributes. `input:required` is common, but you can use `[data-state="active"]` to style elements based on JavaScript-driven states.
  * **`:is(...)`**: This is a powerful "DRY" (Don't Repeat Yourself) selector. It takes a list of selectors and matches any of them, saving you from writing long, repetitive selector chains.

### 2\. Keyframe Animations (`@keyframes`)

Your intermediate doc covered `transition`, which is a simple A-to-B change. **`@keyframes`** are for multi-step, complex, and looping animations.

**Code Snippet:**

```css
/* 1. Define the "story" of the animation */
@keyframes fadeInAndUp {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(20px);
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}

/* 2. Apply the animation to an element */
.my-element {
  animation-name: fadeInAndUp;
  animation-duration: 0.5s;
  animation-timing-function: ease-out;
  animation-fill-mode: backwards; /* Ensures element starts at 0% state */
}
```

**Conceptual Explanations:**

  * **`@keyframes`**: This is where you define the "stops" (from `0%` to `100%`) of your animation. You can have many stops (e.g., `0%`, `25%`, `70%`, `100%`).
  * **`animation-name`**: This links the element to the `@keyframes` definition.
  * **`animation-duration`**: How long the *entire* animation (from 0% to 100%) takes.
  * **`animation-fill-mode: backwards`**: This is an advanced property. It tells the element to apply the styles from the `0%` keyframe *before* the animation even starts. This prevents the element from "flickering" into view before fading in.

### 3\. Advanced Grid: Intrinsic Layouts (`minmax`, `auto-fit`)

Your intermediate doc used `grid-template-areas` to "draw" a specific, static layout. Advanced Grid is about creating **intrinsic**, responsive layouts that automatically adjust to the content and screen size, with *no media queries*.

**Code Snippet:** (A responsive card grid)

```html
<div class="card-grid">
  <div class="card">...</div>
  <div class="card">...</div>
  <div class="card">...</div>
  <div class="card">...</div>
</div>
```

```css
.card-grid {
  display: grid;
  /* This is the magic line */
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

**Conceptual Explanations:**

  * **`repeat(...)`**: A function to create repeating tracks.
  * **`auto-fit`**: This keyword tells the grid: "Create as many columns as will fit in the available space."
  * **`minmax(300px, 1fr)`**: This is the rule for *each* of those columns. It says:
      * "Each column must be *at least* `300px` wide."
      * "If there's extra space, stretch them up to a *maximum* of `1fr` (1 share of the free space)."
  * **The Result**: On a wide screen, you'll get 4 columns. On a tablet, it might automatically drop to 2 columns. On a phone, it will automatically become 1 column. You've created a fully responsive grid with **one line of CSS**.

### 4\. Graphical Effects (`filter`, `backdrop-filter`, `clip-path`)

This is how you break out of the "box" and create modern, graphical designs.

**Code Snippet:**

```css
/* 1. "Glassmorphism" Effect */
.glass-panel {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);
}

/* 2. Grayscale-to-Color Image */
.portfolio-item img {
  filter: grayscale(100%);
  transition: filter 0.3s ease;
}
.portfolio-item:hover img {
  filter: grayscale(0%);
}

/* 3. Non-Rectangular Shapes */
.hexagon {
  clip-path: polygon(25% 0%, 75% 0%, 100% 50%, 75% 100%, 25% 100%, 0% 50%);
}
```

**Conceptual Explanations:**

  * **`backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`**: This is the key to "frosted glass." It applies a `blur()` to whatever is *behind* the element.
  * **`filter: grayscale(100%)`**: This applies a graphical effect (like Photoshop) to the element itself. You can also use `blur()`, `brightness()`, `saturate()`, etc.
  * **`clip-path: polygon(...)`**: This "cuts out" the element into a shape. The `polygon()` function takes a list of X/Y coordinates to draw a custom shape. This is how you escape the rectangle.

### 5\. Container Queries (`@container`)

Media queries (`@media`) let you change styles based on the **viewport** (the page). **Container queries** (`@container`) are the new, advanced way: they let you change styles based on the element's **parent container**. This is the key to "component-based" design.

**Code Snippet:**

```html
<div class="container-wrapper"> <main>
    <div class="my-component">...</div> </main>
  <aside>
    <div class="my-component">...</div> </aside>
</div>
```

```css
/* 1. Define an element as a "query container" */
main,
aside {
  container-type: inline-size;
  container-name: card-container;
}

/* 2. The component's default styles */
.my-component {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
}

/* 3. The Query: "When this component lives inside a
      container named 'card-container' that is 
      wider than 400px, change its layout" */
@container card-container (min-width: 400px) {
  .my-component {
    grid-template-columns: 100px 1fr; /* Go to 2-column layout */
  }
}
```

**Conceptual Explanations:**

  * **`container-type: inline-size`**: This "turns on" container queries for an element, telling the browser to "watch" its width.
  * **`@container (min-width: 400px)`**: This is the query. It works just like a media query, but it's based on the *parent container's* width, not the whole page.
  * **Why it's advanced:** The `.my-component` in `<main>` (which is wide) might be 2 columns, while the *exact same component* in `<aside>` (which is narrow) will automatically be 1 column. The component adapts to its *context*, not the page. This is the future of modular CSS.
